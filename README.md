# LoanMate
This app is an end-to-end machine learning project that predicts whether any loan application will be approved or not and provides the probability of the same.

In this project, I conducted a detailed analysis of the dataset and preprocessed it. I also visualized the datasets. Furthermore, I compared various machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision tree classifier, SVC, random forest classifier, and gradient boosting classifier.

I trained the models on multiple features to ensure more accurate predictions. Upon comparing the accuracy of these algorithms, I found that the Random Forest classifier achieved the highest accuracy among all models, reaching 98%.

Finally, with the assistance of Streamlit, I created a webpage where users can input certain measures to determine whether a loan application will be approved or not.
